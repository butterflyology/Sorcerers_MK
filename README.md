# Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom

### Chris Hamm

This project is to create a shiny app to help quickly list the weaknesses of the villains for the intermediate difficulty level of the game.

Two main files in the <kbd>data</kbd>:

- `spells.csv`: Contains all the known spells and their statistics.
- `villains.csv`: Contains the villains you will face as well as their strengths and weaknesses.


Major commits:

- 2019-12-16: Initial commit with the two main data files in place.
